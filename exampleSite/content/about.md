I started my journey on Hack The Box (HTB), where I am actively learning and tackling Capture 
The Flag (CTF) challenges to hone my skills. As I continue to grow, I am particularly fascinated by defensive security, with a 
strong interest in areas like malware analysis, threat intelligence, and digital forensics. I am driven by the “behind-the-scenes” 
elements of security, and following the trail of an attacker has become a key motivation in my development within the cyber 
defensive domain.
